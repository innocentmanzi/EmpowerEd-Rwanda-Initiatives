# EmpowerEd-Rwanda-Initiatives
My project (EmpowerEd Rwanda Initiatives) targeted people located in Rwanda's local refugee community with an innovative platform going with the ways on areas with problems of education, women empowerment, and job creation, which will establish accessibility of quality educational institutions, promote gender equality through awareness campaigns and skill-building programs, and facilitate the creation of employment opportunities through vocational training and entrepreneurship support. This will address the educational needs, empower women, and boost economic growth in Rwanda's Local Refugee communities. This project aims to fight for high-quality education for refugees like everyone has never seen before. By providing refugees with high access to education, we nurture their talents and skills and empower them with the tools they need to contribute to their host countries and one day play a part in rebuilding their nation. My audacious project is to test the ability to scale to bring courses that lead refugees as the pathways to employment and those who don't have access to higher education.
